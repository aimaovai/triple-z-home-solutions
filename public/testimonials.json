      "text": "We originally hired for ceiling fan installation and ended up needing his services for additional projects in our new construction home. He installed hardware on our kitchen cabinets and bathrooms, an alkaline water filtration system in the kitchen, surround sound for our pre-wired speaker system, and he built extra wood shelves for one of our hall closets so we could maximize the space. I don't have pictures of all the work, only because it was all excellent work! Was nice not to have to hire several people to come in and out of the house. Would hire him ten times over."
